# LSTM-EEG data
This project aims to use the relatively mature brain wave acquisition equipment on the market and based on the long-term and short-term memory neural network algorithm to explore the design of a human-computer interaction system that can convert the brain wave signal sequence into fixed instructions and thus manipulate the robot movement
